android-hybridchoice
====================


This project demonstrates how to create a `ListView` in Android that combines the behavior of `CHOICE_MODE_SINGLE` and `CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE_MODAL`. This means that an item in the list can be _opened_ and simultaneously multiple items in the list can be _chosen_.

![This is what we want to achieve][1]


The GMail app, Play Store app and Google I/O 2013 app all exhibit this behavior with slight variations.

Take a look at [this blog post](http://curioustechizen.blogspot.com/2013/06/android-listviews-hybrid-choice-behavior.html) for more details.

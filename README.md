This project demonstrates how to create a `ListView` in Android that combines the behavior of `CHOICE_MODE_SINGLE` and `CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE_MODAL`. This means that an item in the list can be _opened_ and simultaneously multiple items in the list can be _chosen_.

The GMail app, Play Store app and Google I/O 2013 app all exhibit this behavior with slight variations.

Take a look at this blog post (INSERT_BLOG_URL_HERE) for more details.
